# Auto Steamworks Exec
Supported version: 421470 (V15.11.00)
App Version: 18.0

Functionality
Reads game memory and finds the "expected" key pattern that the Steamworks needs and then Types that pattern.
Restarts automatically when the Steamworks game is over IF if you have enough fuel and skips animations if setup correctly (presses X - the default animation cancel keyboard button)
Stops automatically if you are out of fuel or you press the stop button.
Random Pattern clicking if the app is out of date - checks game version against internal version - This provides random results of course, but better than nothing until app is updated.

Introduced a menu to chose what type of run you want.

[*New*] 
Possibility to choose:
	- Configurable value **ShouldConsumeAllFuel** added to AutoSteamApp.exe.config option was added to setup using ALL the fuel or Only the Natural Fuel
	- Default value is **true**
	
[*New*] 
Do a smart RANDOM run:
	- New functionality to do a RANDOM run - this will give random results, as no memory reading is happening. 
	- The other functions of the application will still work (fuel checking, automatic stop and restart etc). 
	- Random Run will be available even if the app is up to date.
