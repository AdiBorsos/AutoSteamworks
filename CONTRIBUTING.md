Since this is open-source there are only a few rules i want to specify:

- you are allowed to fork and develop your own features, add pull requests, bugs and suggest features

=> For this to happen
- you are NOT allowed to publish a version of this on your own. I am more than happy to have you as a contributor and will always make sure to credit your work. If i missed to do that, please remind me and i will.
- you are NOT allowed to delete code, unless we decide together that it is a good idea. Even if sometimes the repo will have unused libraries/classes/etc., i want to be part of the decision
- you are NOT allowed to rebrand or rename the application and/or modules of the application.
